    Now you will see an action verb that you were shown earlier. Your job is to bring back to mind the object
    that you imagined being involved with this word and to report information about the object's semantic or visual features.
    <br>
    A question screen presented before the action verb will indicate which feature you are to report on:
    <br>
    ""animate vs. inanimate"" or ""photo vs. drawing"".
    <br>
    Press the left arrow button for animate/photo or the right arrow button for inanimate/drawing.
    <br>
    If you forgot the object associated with the verb, press the down arrow.

    As you practiced earlier, you will now see an action verb that you were shown earlier. Your job is to bring back to mind the object
    that you imagined being involved with this word and to report information about the object's semantic or visual features.
    <br>
    A question screen presented before the action verb will indicate which feature you are to report on:
    <br>
    ""animate vs. inanimate"" or ""photo vs. drawing"".
    <br>
    Press the left arrow button for animate/photo or the right arrow button for inanimate/drawing.
    <br>
    If you forgot the object associated with the verb, press the down arrow.
    Please respond as quickly as possible, and use your dominant hand to make your responses.

    As you practiced earlier, you will now see an action verb that you were shown earlier. Your job is to bring back to mind the object
    that you imagined being involved with this word and to report information about the object's semantic or visual features.
    <br>
    A question screen presented before the action verb will indicate which feature you are to report on:
    <br>
    ""animate vs. inanimate"" or ""photo vs. drawing"".
    <br>
    Press the left arrow button for animate/photo or the right arrow button for inanimate/drawing.
    <br>
    If you forgot the object associated with the verb, press the down arrow.
    Please respond as quickly as possible, and use your dominant hand to make your responses.

    As you practiced earlier, you will now see an action verb that you were shown earlier. Your job is to bring back to mind the object
    that you imagined being involved with this word and to report information about the object's semantic or visual features.
    <br>
    A question screen presented before the action verb will indicate which feature you are to report on:
    <br>
    ""animate vs. inanimate"" or ""photo vs. drawing"".
    <br>
    Press the left arrow button for animate/photo or the right arrow button for inanimate/drawing.
    <br>
    If you forgot the object associated with the verb, press the down arrow.
    Please respond as quickly as possible, and use your dominant hand to make your responses.

    As you practiced earlier, you will now see an action verb that you were shown earlier. Your job is to bring back to mind the object
    that you imagined being involved with this word and to report information about the object's semantic or visual features.
    <br>
    A question screen presented before the action verb will indicate which feature you are to report on:
    <br>
    ""animate vs. inanimate"" or ""photo vs. drawing"".
    <br>
    Press the left arrow button for animate/photo or the right arrow button for inanimate/drawing.
    <br>
    If you forgot the object associated with the verb, press the down arrow.
    Please respond as quickly as possible, and use your dominant hand to make your responses.

    <br>When you read the first set of instructions, you may have created a vivid mental image involving the word ""find"" and a drawing of a dog.

    As you practiced earlier, you will now see an action verb that you were shown earlier. Your job is to bring back to mind the object
    that you imagined being involved with this word and to report information about the object's semantic or visual features.
    <br>
    A question screen presented before the action verb will indicate which feature you are to report on:
    <br>
    ""animate vs. inanimate"" or ""photo vs. drawing"".
    <br>
    Press the left arrow button for animate/photo or the right arrow button for inanimate/drawing.
    <br>
    If you forgot the object associated with the verb, press the down arrow.
    Please respond as quickly as possible, and use your dominant hand to make your responses.
    <br>
    <img src=""/static/instructions_pics/retrieval_pic.png"" height=""350px"">
    <br>When you read the first set of instructions, you may have created a vivid mental image involving the word ""find"" and a drawing of a dog.
    In these examples trials shown above, the correct response for the top row is ""animate"", whereas the correct response for the bottom row is ""drawing"".

    <p>Thank you for your participation!</p>
    The goal of this study is to replicate previous findings that the timing of responses in memory-dependent tasks
    is rhythmic in nature (compared to the timing of responses in memory-independent tasks).
    <br>
    Your participation will allow us to better understand how memory works.
